title: Punxsutawney Phil
description: In 2017 the Pittsburgh Society of Illustrators had its 20th
  anniversary exhibit at the Senator John Heinz History Center. Our title was
  Art of Facts | Uncovering Pittsburgh Stories and focused on lesser known
  Western PA trivia. I chose to create an infographic on the statistics and lore
  surrounding Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day.
