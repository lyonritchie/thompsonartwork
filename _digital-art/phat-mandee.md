title: Phat Mandee
description: This portrait of Phat Man Dee was created for a KA-BLAM! fundraiser
  benefitting the ToonSeum. The theme was "Pittsburgh Characters," paying
  tribute to local folks with distinctive personalities. I'm not a Pittsburgh
  native, so I had to do a little research before I chose Phat Man Dee. She was
  a just blast to draw, and I was able to make it to one of her shows to see her
  perform. I had the art printed on metallic paper.
