title: Welcome 2016
description: I like to create my own card for each new year. Usually I choose
  something scientific or medical to send to my clients, but when 2016 was
  rolling in I just felt like creating something cozy and familiar. This is one
  of my BIG mugs, a two-hander. I think that was a tea year for me. I'm on
  coffee these days. This was also me trying a new digital technique using the
  smudge tool and some Photoshop filters to make a rougher line with a warmer
  look.
