title: Skull Face
description: When I changed the name of my medical illustration business I
  wanted to create a promotional piece to make the announcement to my clients.
  It was also an opportunity to use a digital painting technique I hadn't tried
  before, using photography as a template layer in Photoshop. I needed to
  manipulate the shape of the skull to fit my features. Usually, the light
  source comes from the upper left in medical art, but I chose to use strong
  lighting from the right on this piece so the image reads old to new from left
  to right.
