Would you make time for art if you knew every piece would be a masterpiece? Probably. Do you resist making art because you’re afraid you’ll end up with something lousy? I can identify with the latter, and it’s not uncommon. But focusing solely on the end result takes the joy out of what should be a rewarding pastime. Rethinking the goal of art-making can help.

I like to compare making art to playing an instrument. Did you ever see a kid bang on a piano just because they wanted to see what it sounded like? Maybe you have a keyboard you noodle with while dinner’s in the oven, or maybe you bought a guitar specifically to learn one song you love. Odds are you didn’t expect to master the instrument in a day, and you might not intend to ever master it. You enjoy making music for the fun of it, whether anyone’s listening or not. Whether you or anyone else thinks you're good or not.

In my house, I’ve got a fiddle I play almost daily and a chromatic harmonica that collects dust. The fiddle I’ve worked at for almost 30 years, feeling from the start that it would be a lifetime passion. I took it seriously and had lessons as a kid and again as an adult. I practice even when I don’t really feel like it, because it’s important to me, and I’m always glad I put in the time. I know that next time I pick it up, I won’t have stiff hands or forget that new tune I’ve been working on. I know that if I stay sharp I’ll perform better when it really matters - when I have an audience and I’m being paid to play well.

In contrast, I got my “paperweight” on a whim after I saw the Buckeye State Harmonica Band perform in Whetstone Park in Columbus around 2007. They were really good, and I was inspired to immediately get my own harmonica. But it’s way harder (for me) to play than I thought it would be, and I never applied myself to getting any good at it, so it mostly stays in its case on the shelf. I still take it out a few times a year to play some tunes though, and that’s fine. I don’t slam the case shut and berate myself for being a terrible musician. I just have fun with it and move on. Maybe someday I’ll put more effort into it. Maybe not.

Drawing well, like mastering an instrument, often takes a lot of regular practice and a critical approach to improvement. But doodling (or playing, or painting, or sculpting, etc) for the pure joy of it can be done any time by anyone, no matter how much experience or skill they have or lack.

So why don’t more people make art to relax or express themselves? Why do so many people tell me they’re not artistic or seem discouraged about the art they *do* make?

I think it’s due to the nature of art vs other hobbies. What do you get when you read a book, practice yoga or play an instrument for an hour? There may not be much evidence of your time spent, but you feel a calmness. Like meditating, you escape to the zone for a while, and when you emerge to face the rest of your day you feel refreshed. Maybe it was a little more difficult this time, because you pushed yourself harder or you hadn’t practiced in a while, but you’re still glad you did it. The words passed through your mind as you read them, you exhaled all your inhales, and the notes you played resonated for mere moments before they disappeared; I can picture them floating out the window, like they never existed.

What do you get when you do a terrible drawing? A terrible drawing! It’s there right in front of you. You look at it over and over and nitpick everything wrong with it. It hits you all at once, unlike a book that you might not judge fully until you’ve had time to think it over, or a clumsy workout that won’t make you sore until tomorrow. You decide that all of your ability is summed up in this single attempt, and you might use it to make blanket statements about your perceived limitations.

Is that the difference - the permanence of the end product? Is that little piece of paper going to crush you just because it’s still here?

Only if you let it. So don’t let it! Throw it away, erase it, tear it up, burn it, keep it in a folder with all of your other terrible, terrible creations. Who cares what you do with it? You certainly shouldn’t.

Allow yourself to reap all the benefits of practice and forget about assigning yourself a grade. You didn’t make this thing for anyone but yourself, just like you weren’t studying for an exam, instructing a live yoga class or playing music for a wedding. It didn’t have to be perfect, because it wasn’t a performance. It was practice. So don’t fret! It was still good for you.

Fiddles don’t have frets by the way, so I can’t fret when I practice music. That’s a bit of a joke, but I really do try my best to apply this whole metaphor to artwork. It reminds me that practice is just that. It is time well spent no matter what I think of the final product.
