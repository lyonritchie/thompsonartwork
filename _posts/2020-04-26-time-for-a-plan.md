Launching a website for my personal art was overdue, and (I truly think) necessary to my growth as an artist. I am restricted from having more than one profile on some professional websites, and I’ve thought myself in circles over the consequences of muddying up my brand by including anything that deviates from my brand.

So here I am (you can read my [Artist Statement](/about#artist-statement) for more of my background) and my reasons for establishing a separate website are as follows:

1. I will always create more than I am commissioned to create.
2. Experimentation with technique is something I prefer to do in my free time—not on a deadline.
3. I doodle in several notebooks and on scraps of paper that I sometimes lose for years (or forever) and I’d like to keep track of my work.
4. Tracking my progress in an organized, visual way motivates me to create more often.
5. Failures and successes are all progress, and I hope that by sharing some of both I might encourage others to branch out with their own artwork.
6. I am interested in other people’s art, and I will entertain the idea that someone, somewhere, might be interested in mine.
7. Keeping a structured schedule is difficult while waiting for client feedback. I welcome the opportunity to run this project on the side during the inevitable gaps in workflow. It may just keep me from reading too much news in the morning.
8. There is value in what I have learned as a working artist.
9. There is value in what I have learned overall as a creative person navigating life.

I could go on, but 9 is a great number. I think I can summarize what readers and viewers can expect from my blog moving forward with one sentence. I will be discussing how I make art and enjoy it, whether working on commissions or practicing a creative habit for emotional well-being.
